\section{Existing Data Visualizing Service}

The existing service, as detailed in \cite{nowak2024pvw}, provides a web-based
framework for sharing and visualizing research data. The visualization
functionality leverages Kitware's ParaViewWeb Framework for browser-based remote
rendering. The ParaView-like web application allows users to directly visualize
simulation results interactively in their web browser without the need to
download large datasets. The service is realized on a LRZ Compute Cloud (CC)
instance serving ParaView Visualizer and an Apache HTTP server functioning as a
reverse proxy.

It seamlessly integrates with LRZ's Data-Science-Storage (DSS) as it is
connected to the CC instance via an NFS mount. Users can share specific folders
from their personal DSS directory with external researchers who do not have
direct access to the LRZ. This is achieved through unique access links, similar
to file-sharing services like Google Drive or Dropbox.
