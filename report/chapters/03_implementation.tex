\chapter{Implementation}\label{chapter:implementation}

This chapter contains detailed information on the rationale and how solutions
are implemented. It also gives instructions on how to install them. It assumes
the reader has ssh access to the server, sudo privileges, access to the source
code and has cloned the code repository on the server as detailed in appendix
\ref{chapter:code}.

\section{Existing Data Visualization Service}

The existing service, as detailed in~\cite{nowak2024pvw}, provides a web-based
framework for sharing and visualizing research data. The visualization
functionality leverages Kitware's ParaViewWeb Framework for browser-based remote
rendering. The ParaView-like web application allows users to directly visualize
simulation results interactively in their web browser without the need to
download large datasets. The service is realized on a LRZ Compute Cloud (CC)
instance serving ParaView Visualizer and an Apache HTTP server functioning as a
reverse proxy.

It seamlessly integrates with LRZ's Data Science Storage (DSS) as it is
connected to the CC instance via an NFS mount. Users can share specific folders
from their personal DSS directory with external researchers who do not have
direct access to the LRZ. This is achieved through unique access links, similar
to file-sharing services like Google Drive or Dropbox.

\subsection{Fixing ParaView OSMesa and glibc Issue}

In February Ubuntu 22.04 LTS upgraded its GNU C Library, commonly known as
\textit{glibc}, to version 2.35. This broke the existing data visualization
service as the used ParaView Server is incompatible with the upgraded
\textit{glibc}. The underlying problem is the \textit{OSMesa} binary used by
ParaView for software rendering and is further described in this GitLab
Issue~\cite{kitwareOsmesaBinary}. Until this report's submission date there has
not been a fix for this issue.

As proposed by the ParaView maintainers in~\cite{paraviewUsingUbuntu}
workarounds for this bug are

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using \textit{EGL} flavor of ParaView Server
    \item Compiling ParaView with \textit{OSMesa} locally
    \item Downgrading \textit{glibc}
\end{enumerate}

Option 1 requires a CC instance with a graphics card as the \textit{EGL} variant
uses hardware rendering. However, as currently the demand for GPUs is
unquestionably high, they are no instances with GPU available. Option 2 is an
involved task with software projects of considerable size as in the case of
ParaView, making it also infeasible. Thus, we have decided on option 3 by
setting up a new CC instance running on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS that comes with
\textit{glibc} version 2.31 and installing the data visualization service again.
This is because \textit{glibc} is a very common dependency and downgrading it in
a live system would lead to further incompatibilities with other software.

\subsubsection*{Instructions for the workaround}

For the most part appendix B (Anleitung zur Bereitstellung)
of~\cite{nowak2024pvw} can be followed to install the existing service and
helper scripts on a new CC instance. Note that as the source code is not
publicly available anymore instead of using curl to download needed files, we
assume the reader already has every file needed by cloning the code repository.
After following appendix~\ref{chapter:code} to do so, the reader would need to
change to the directory that contains needed files. 

For example instead of
\begin{terminal}
    curl -fSLOJ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FabianNowak/pv-visualizer-multi-project-config/releases/<directory>/<needed-file>
\end{terminal}

The following suffices
\begin{terminal}
    cd <directory>
\end{terminal}

The custom executable \texttt{pv-session-mapper} written in Rust has to be
compiled locally as \textit{glibc} is dynamically linked. This means at section
\textbf{pv-session-mapper installieren} follow these instructions instead

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First install Rust and its build system Cargo by using \textit{rustup}
    \begin{terminal}
        curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    \end{terminal}
    It will download a script, and start the installation. If everything went
    well \texttt{Rust is installed now. Great!} should appear.
    \item Change into source directory and compile locally
    \begin{terminal}
        cd pv-session-mapper/session_mapper
        cargo build --release
    \end{terminal}
    \item Create target directory, copy and adjust custom binary
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo mkdir /opt/pv-session-mapper
        sudo cp target/release/pv-session-mapper /opt/pv-session-mapper
        sudo chown root:root /opt/pv-session-mapper/pv-session-mapper
        sudo chmod +x /opt/pv-session-mapper/pv-session-mapper
    \end{terminal}
\end{enumerate}

Once through the tutorial, these final adjustments on the Apache Server have to
be made

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Activate Apache Server module \texttt{proxy\_wstunnel} with 
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
    \end{terminal}
    \item Restart Apache Server to load new configuration with
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo systemctl restart apache2
    \end{terminal}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reorganizing Apache HTTP Server configuration}

The existing data visualization service will need a publicly accessible landing
page and a protected new user portal after SSO login via DFN-AAI was successful.
It is best practice to separate the web app i.e. ParaViewWeb from the marketing
site. Benefits are that non-technical staff can independently modify content of
the landing page without possibly breaking the web app. One way to achieve a
separation is with the help of subdomains. 

In our design, the landing page will be reachable under
\texttt{marge.aer.ed.tum.de} whereas the service will be bound to the subdomain
\texttt{pvw.marge.aer.ed.tum.de}. This setup also simplifies DNS configuration,
the system responsible for translating human-readable names to actual routeable
IP-addresses, as only two records are needed. An A-Record for linking
\texttt{marge.aer.ed.tum.de} to the CC instance's floating IP-address as well as
a wildcard DNS record linking \texttt{*.marge.aer.ed.tum.de} to the same
IP-address. The wildcard record will match for every subdomain, even not yet
existing ones, making this setup suitable for future requirements. 

In order to achieve aforementioned behavior, Apache's virtual host feature is
leveraged, allowing different content to be served over the same Apache server,
depending on the host name used in the request. ParaViewWeb continues to use its
existing subdirectory whereas the landing page is served from a new
subdirectory.

This means the existing \texttt{paraview-multi-user.conf} is to be moved from
\texttt{conf-available} to \texttt{sites-available} directory, the usual place
where virtual configurations are placed, slightly changed to account for the
subdomain as seen in Listing~\ref{lst:002-pvw} and a new landing page
configuration shown in Listing~\ref{lst:001-marge} is to be added. Note how
Apache resolves which virtual host to serve with the help of the configured
\texttt{ServerName}.

The new landing page configuration resembles a standard site configuration and
is constructed in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual host configurations are enclosed in a \texttt{<VirtualHost>}
    directive, meaning that everything nested within only applies to the defined
    VirtualHost.
    \item In line 2, \texttt{ServerName} specifies under which name the
    landing page is accessible.
    \item \texttt {DocumentRoot} in line 5 specifies which directory serves
    the landing page's content.
    \item \texttt{ErrorLog} and \texttt{CustomLog} define in which
    location the virtual host's error and access logs are saved.
    \texttt{APACHE\_LOG\_DIR} is a provided variable and resolves to the
    standard location \texttt{/var/log/apache2}.
    \item Lines 10-14 allow the Apache server to access the files provided in
    line 5.
\end{itemize}

\lstinputlisting[
    style=sourcecode,
    float=htp,
    label={lst:001-marge},
    caption={\texttt{001-marge.conf}: Apache configuration for Landing Page}
]{../apache-config/sites-available/001-marge.conf}

The changes made to ParaViewWeb's Apache configuration are minor and consist of
enclosing the configuration in a \texttt{<VirtualHost>} directive,  in line 2
and specifying an own subdirectory \texttt{/var/log/apache2/pvw} for storing the
web app's Apache logs in line 12-13 to separate concerns.

\lstinputlisting[
    style=sourcecode,
    float=htp,
    label={lst:002-pvw},
    caption={\texttt{002-pvw.conf}: Apache configuration for ParaViewWeb}
]{../apache-config/sites-available/002-pvw.conf}

\subsubsection*{Instructions for reorganizing Apache HTTP Server configuration}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a folder to serve files for landing page
    \texttt{marge.aer.ed.tum.de}
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo mkdir /var/www/html/marge
    \end{terminal}
    \item Create a folder to store ParaViewWeb's log files
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/pvw
    \end{terminal}
    \item Adjust \texttt{pv-configurator} settings to reflect ParaViewWeb
    subdomain. Open and edit \texttt{configurator\_settings.json} with root
    privileges
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo vim /srv/pv-configurator/configurator_settings.json
    \end{terminal}
    \item Make following change and save file
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\small, frame=single]
        {
            "servername": "pvw.marge.aer.ed.tum.de",
            ...
        }
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item Change into configuration directory and copy both into Apache
    configuration
    \begin{terminal}
        cd apache-config/sites-available
        sudo cp 001-marge.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available
        sudo cp 002-pvw.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available
    \end{terminal}
    \item Deactivate old ParaViewWeb Apache configuration
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo a2disconf paraview-multi-project
    \end{terminal}
    At this point \texttt{paraview-multi-project.conf} could be deleted as it
    is no longer used.
    \item Finally, activate new configuration and restart Apache server
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo a2ensite 001-marge
        sudo a2ensite 002-pvw
        sudo systemctl restart apache2
    \end{terminal}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Creating a New User Portal}

The existing data visualization service allows users without LRZ credentials to
access shared projects via a unique access link. We want to extend the sharing
functionality to the same target group of non LRZ users. Additionally, new user
creation currently requires human involvement in processing such a request in
authenticating and creating a new Linux user on the CC instance. The goal is to
automize user management with the help of a self-service new user portal that
any authenticated user by the DFN-AAI can access. 

Our solution proposition consists of a form which is protected by DFN-AAI login,
collects necessary data and upon submission runs a server side script in the
background to create a new Linux user. Data collected include the new user's
first name, last name from which a username is generated as well as a desired
password for the new Linux account. Further, depending on whether the new user
has data on DSS to share, LRZ username (which will be the Linux username instead
of the generated) and \textit{userid} on DSS are collected. The script shall add
the user to necessary groups to allow ParaView sharing usage and set correct
\textit{userid} for DSS folder access. DSS connection has to still be done by
hand as detailed in appendix D (Anleitung: DSS-Verzeichnis mittels bindfs mit
anderen Nutzern auf der Compute-Cloud-Instanz teilen) of~\cite{nowak2024pvw}.

We realized the form with the help of an HTML form, which upon submission runs a
PHP script validating input and finally executes with sudo privileges a bash
script creating the actual Linux user. PHP has been chosen as it is well
integrated with Apache, making it a common choice for web-based applications on
Linux servers. Security is of concern as this setup allows users to execute
privileged commands on the underlying Linux server, risking potential injection
attacks. This risk will be mitigated by thoroughly sanitizing and validating
user input in the server-side PHP script. In addition, proper access control and
logging are set in place, as further described in section~\ref{section:logging}.

\subsection{HTML form}

\lstinputlisting[
    language=html,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={1-2,24-48},
    float=htp,
    label={lst:htmlform},
    caption={\texttt{index.html}: New User Form}
]{../newuser/index.html}

Listing~\ref{lst:htmlform} depicts the form collecting user information needed
for Linux account creation and is built the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{<form>} definition in line 5 ensures that from data will
    be sent using a \textit{POST} method and points to \texttt{create\_user.php}
    script on the server handling user creation.
    \item Line 6-13 define basic form fields for first name, last name, email
    and password. Each consists of a \texttt{label} and \texttt{input} for text,
    email and password fields respectively. The \texttt{for} attribute in the
    label is associated with the \texttt{id} of the input field to ensure
    accessibility. The \textit{name} attribute in the input field identifies
    this field with its value in the form data sent to the server. Email and
    password input types come with built-in email validation and hides entered
    characters are hidden from view.
    \item Line 15-16 is a checkbox input for users to indicate whether they want
    to share data on DSS and used to conditionally show the second set of
    fields and is further explained below.
    \item Second set of fields from line 17-22 wrapped in a \texttt{<fieldset>}
    tag are for inputting \textit{LRZ username} and \textit{uid on DSS} and also
    consist of a \texttt{label} and \texttt{input} tag. The \textit{uid} input
    is restricted to numbers between 1000 and 59999, the range uids are
    typically reserved for users in Linux distributions.
    \item Finally, line 24 is a submit button that sends the form data to the
    server when clicked.
\end{itemize}

\lstinputlisting[
    language=html,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={3-23},
    float=ht,
    label={lst:formstyle},
    caption={\texttt{index.html}: New User Portal Stylesheet}
]{../newuser/index.html}

The \texttt{<style>} block in \texttt{index.html} seen in
Listing~\ref{lst:formstyle} contains CSS rules for showing and hiding the input
fields for \textit{LRZ username} and \textit{uid on DSS} conditionally based on
the state of the checkbox. The rules are defined for classes \textit{control}
and \textit{conditional} and are applied respectively by assigning UI elements
with the corresponding class and works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First block specifies when class \texttt{.control} is checked then the
    \texttt{.conditional} elements that follow them in the DOM are styled to be
    visible with properties from line 3-8. 
    \item Second block specifies when class \textit{.control} is not checked
    then the \textit{.conditional} elements are styled to be hidden with
    properties from line 12-19. These properties effectively hide the
    \texttt{.conditional} elements from view while maintaining a minimal
    footprint in the
    layout.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Create User PHP Script}

The Server-Side PHP Script handling form submission capabilities are two-folds:
Sanitization as well as validating user input and executing create user shell
script with cleaned user input. The realized PHP script is split up in
Listing~\ref{lst:phpvalidate} and Listing~\ref{lst:phpexecute} accordingly.

Sanitization involves cleaning the input to remove or neutralize potentially
harmful characters. We need to ensure that the input does not contain characters
that could be used for command injection. Validation ensures that the input
adheres to expected formats and constraints. This step makes sure that the data
is not only sanitized but also logically correct. Listing~\ref{lst:phpvalidate}
works the following way:

\lstinputlisting[
    language=php,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={1-1, 9-43},
    float=htp,
    label={lst:phpvalidate},
    caption={\texttt{create\_user.php}: Server-Side Script Validating User Input}
]{../newuser/create_user.php}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{if} statement in line 2 checks if the form was submitted using
    the \textit{POST} method, ensuring that the script only processes form data
    when the form is submitted correctly.
    \item Lines 3-8 retrieve form data and assign them to variables for further
    usage and sanitize them using \texttt{escapeshellcmd}. This is a built-in
    PHP function making sure that special characters are escaped, making it safe
    to use these values in shell commands.
    \item \texttt{if} clause from line 10-13 checks if any of the required
    fields \textit{fname, lname, password} are empty. If any are missing an
    error message is displayed and the script exits.
    \item Line 15-19 use a regular expression to validate that the first name
    consists of 3 to 30 alphabetic characters, possibly followed by spaces.
    Again in case of a mismatch appropriate error message is displayed and the
    script exists.
    \item Line 20-23 is the same code as described above but validates the last
    name.
    \item Line 25-28 validates in case of a non empty \textit{lrzuser} field
    that it adheres to a LRZ username pattern (e.g., ab12xyz).
    \item If a username is provided as is the case when a user has data on DSS
    to share, line 30-35 check if the user already exists on the CC instance to
    avoid duplication. This is done by running the shell command \texttt{id -u}
    with the provided username as an argument enclosed in
    \texttt{escapeshellarg} and saving its return value in the \texttt{output}
    variable. \texttt{escapeshellarg} is a built-in PHP function escaping a
    string to be used as a single argument to a shell command. If the user
    already exists the \textit{id} command returns a non-empty value and an
    error message is shown.
\end{itemize}

\lstinputlisting[
    language=php,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={45-55, 58-59, 61-64},
    float=htp,
    label={lst:phpexecute},
    caption={\texttt{create\_user.php}: Server-Side Script Executing Shell Script}
]{../newuser/create_user.php}

Listing~\ref{lst:phpexecute} prepares the commands to the final shell script
before it is executed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Depending on whether \textit{lrzuser} and \textit{uid} are provided,
    line 1-9 construct the appropriate arguments for the shell command and saves
    it in the \texttt{args} variable. Arguments are constructed by concatenating
    first name, last name and optionally lrzuser or uid with their corresponding
    flags, e.g. \texttt{-f} for fname, and running them again through
    \texttt{escapeshellarg}.
    \item In line 11-12 the final command is built by specifying the shell
    script \textit{bootstrap\_user.sh} and to execute it with \textit{sudo}. The
    required password argument is only appended to the command later for logging
    reasons as described in section~\ref{section:logging}
    \item Line 13 runs the command built using \texttt{shell\_exec} while
    capturing \textit{stdout} and \textit{stderror} and echoing any possible
    output back to the user in line 15.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bootstrap User Shell Script}

The bootstrap user shell script starts with the usage function seen in
listing~\ref{lst:bootstrapusage} as it's a UNIX and Linux convention to include
such in scripts and is printed if wrong arguments are provided.

\lstinputlisting[
    language=bash,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={3-13},
    float=htp,
    label={lst:bootstrapusage},
    caption={\texttt{bootstrap\_user.sh}: usage function}
]{../newuser/bootstrap_user.sh}

\lstinputlisting[
    language=bash,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={15-36},
    float=ht,
    label={lst:bootstrapgenerate},
    caption={\texttt{bootstrap\_user.sh}: generate\_username function}
]{../newuser/bootstrap_user.sh}

Listing~\ref{lst:bootstrapgenerate} shows a helper function to obtain a unique
username from provided first and last name and works the following way:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First the arguments are saved in local variables \texttt{fname} and
    \texttt{lname} in line 1-2. An initial username is created by taking the
    first initial of the first name in line 5 and concatenating it with the last
    name in line 6. In line 8 the initial username is then converted to
    lowercase.
    \item In line 10-19 the loop checks if the initial username already exists
    using the \texttt{id} command. If it exists, a two decimal number (01, 02,
    etc.) is appended to the username until a unique one is found. By that
    moment the loop is exited and the found username is returned in line 21.
\end{itemize}

\lstinputlisting[
    language=bash,
    style=sourcecode,
    linerange={1-2, 37-69},
    float=htp,
    label={lst:bootstrap},
    caption={\texttt{bootstrap\_user.sh}: Create New User Shell Script}
]{../newuser/bootstrap_user.sh}

The actual shell script in listing~\ref{lst:bootstrap} puts the two pieces
together:

\begin{itemize}
    \item From line 3-14 the script processes the command options by iterating
    through the arguments using a while loop. In Bash, arguments are
    automatically parsed by splitting by spaces and made available through the
    variable \texttt{\$1} for the first value, \texttt{\$2} for the second and
    so on. The condition in the loop checks if the number of remaining arguments
    is greater than zero. The \texttt{case} statement in line 4 executes either
    line 5 to 11 depending on the value of \texttt{\$1}, which is the current
    argument. Each argument is handled by matching the expected flag e.g.
    \texttt{-f} or \texttt{--fname}, assigning the following value \texttt{\$2}
    in a variable and finally using \texttt{shift} to move the argument pointer
    to the next argument, effectively skipping the current argument and its
    value. This allows the while loop to terminate after all arguments have been
    handled. Line 10 matches the case when the script is run with the help flag
    and line 11 if the current argument does not match any of the above cases.
    Both return the \textit{usage} string defined in
    listing~\ref{lst:bootstrapusage}.
    \item In line 16-18 he \texttt{-z} test returns true if the variable is
    empty. If that is the case the \textit{usage} function is called.
    \item When the user does not need to share data on DSS and hence the
    \texttt{\$username} variable is empty, we generate a username with the help
    of the \texttt{generate\_username} function seen in
    listing~\ref{lst:bootstrapgenerate}.
    \item The script hashes the password using the \texttt{openssl} command in
    line 21 as is required for the \texttt{useradd} command and saves it in a
    variable for later usage.
    \item In line 23-26 the shell command \texttt{useradd} used to create a new
    linux user is invoked either with or without the \texttt{\$uid} variable as
    argument depending on if the variable is empty. Other arguments provided are
    the username and first/last names which are associated with the created
    linux user. Further, every created user is assigned to the
    \texttt{pv-publisher} user group to allow immediate ParaViewWeb usage.
    \item Finally, in line 29-34 after attempting to create the user, the script
    checks the exit status of the useradd command using \texttt{\$?}, which
    stores the exit status of the last command executed. If the command a
    success message is printed. In case of failure, the outcome is echoed and
    the user is forcefully deleted with \texttt{userdel}.
\end{itemize}

As executing the \texttt{useradd} shell command requires superuser privileges,
we use \textit{sudo} to allow the \texttt{apache-proxy} user to execute only
\texttt{bootstrap\_user.sh} as root without needing a password. This is achieved
by modifying the sudoers configuration and creating a new entry of the form:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
    apache-proxy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /var/www/html/marge/newuser/bootstrap_user.sh
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Instructions for creating a New User Portal}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install PHP 
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
    \end{terminal}
    \item Create target directory to serve New User Portal
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo mkdir /var/www/html/marge/newuser
    \end{terminal}
    \item Create log file and modify file permissions
    \begin{terminal}
        sudo mkdir /var/log/newuser
        sudo touch /var/log/newuser/create_user_php.log
        sudo chown apache-proxy:apache-proxy /var/log/newuser/create_user_php.log
        sudo chmod 640 /var/log/newuser/create_user_php.log
    \end{terminal}
    \item Change into the repository's newuser directory and copy HTML form to
    collect the new user's information, server-side script into target directory
    \begin{terminal}
        cd newuser
        sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/marge/newuser
